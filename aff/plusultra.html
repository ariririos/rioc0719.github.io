            <section>
                <p>The Plus Ultra Initiative is a project of the Academic Framework Forum, an organization of 22 student volunteers with a mission of promoting academic success for everyone at OHS.</p>
                <p>Our work consists of placing Teaching Assistants in various classes, running SAT practice tests, and starting outreach efforts for summer programs; the Plus Ultra Initiative is special in that it targets a much smaller subset of the OHS student body.</p>
                <p>Plus Ultra targets the most talented and ambitious students in the Classses of 2021 and 2020 for a multi-year mentoring relationship with Class of 2018 students.</p>
